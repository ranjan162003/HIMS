 # PROJECT OVERVIEW
 
 The Digital Issue Management System for the hostel is an Android
 application designed to streamline the process of reporting, tracking, and
 resolving maintenance issues and other concerns within hostel facilities. It
 provides residents with an intuitive interface for submitting detailed issue reports
 and enables real-time status tracking to ensure transparency. The system
 facilitates direct communication between residents and hostel management
 through a built-in messaging platform, allowing for prompt responses and
 updates. By prioritizing and efficiently managing reported issues, the application
 aims to enhance resident satisfaction, maintain a high standard of hostel
 management, and improve overall operational efficiency through robust data
 management and reporting tools.
